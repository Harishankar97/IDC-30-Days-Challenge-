In this code I used f string method and escape characters

🔸 f-string → f"Hello, World!\n\tMy name is {name}"
💠 f"" tells Python: "This string will have variables inside {} that should be evaluated."
💠 {name} → Will be replaced by the value of the variable name.


🔸 Escape characters: \n and \t
💠 \n → New Line
 Moves the cursor to the next line.
💠 \t → Tab Space
 Adds a horizontal tab (usually about 4–8 spaces, depending on your editor/terminal).
